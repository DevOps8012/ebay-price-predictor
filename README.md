# Ebay Listing Optimizer through Machine Learning

If you've ever bought something on Ebay, you know that it can be difficult to know if a particular listing is a good deal or not. And if you're selling, it can be hard to determine which options will draw bidders to your auction. What if there was a way to increase the likelihood that you would sell your listing on ebay, just by swapping a few keywords in your title? What if there was a way to filter listings for only the best deals?

To investiage these questions, I dug into actual ebay data and built a machine learning system to help sellers make more sales on ebay, and alert shoppers to the best deals so they can make smarter buying decisions and save money.

In this report, I'll discuss the decisions I made and show revelant code blocks and visualizations that describe my modeling process.
